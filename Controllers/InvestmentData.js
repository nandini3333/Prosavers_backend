            "Product_Name":"<p>A Mutual Fund is a managed portfolio of securities. Investments from all types of persons, be it individual or non-individual are pooled to make a sizeable amount. Such an amount is invested in various securities that may include equity shares or debt products such as bonds, debentures etc. How and in which types of securities a mutual fund invest depends on the objective and strategy of a particular scheme, which is declared by the scheme at the time of its launch. This information is available openly to all, who want to take informed decisions before investing.</p><ul><blockquote><li>A mutual fund is a Trust. However, the pool of money collected from investors is invested and managed by an Asset Management Company (AMC). Each AMC can have many Schemes, each having a specific investment objective and strategy.</li><li>To manage the investors’ money in a mutual fund scheme, the AMC appoints a Fund Manager. Any gain generated by a mutual fund scheme is proportionately distributed amongst the investors of the scheme after adjusting fund management expenses, by calculating the scheme’s Net Asset Value (NAV). As investment in companies gives Shares, investment in mutual funds gives Units. In case of shares we call it Share Price and in case of mutual funds, we call it NAV.</li><li>Every investor may not have a huge chunk of money to invest in securities, be it equity shares of companies or bonds. Some people may not have the time or knowledge or willingness to research a wide range of securities for investing. This is where mutual funds come in as a great relief to investors.</li><li>They appoint fund managers to manage investors’ money based on the schemes’ objective. In return for professional management, time, expenses incurred, tools required, and research done, mutual funds charge a fee, which is adjusted from total assets being managed under a scheme. Such fees are regulated and subjected to certain limits by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).</li></blockquote</ul>",
            "categorization":"<p>A mutual fund is not just one scheme or one type of investment. Often, people who are new to investing are under the false impression that all mutual funds are same except that there are many mutual fund companies with the difference merely being in their names. In fact, each mutual fund can be different from the other depending on the objective the scheme wants to achieve through investing.</p><p>Mutual fund schemes are also differentiated by their investment strategies meaning, which types of companies and securities they invest in, and their percentages. These types are generally called Categories. Every AMC has more than one category of schemes and unlike in the past, an AMC can have only one scheme belonging to a category.</p><p><b>Mutual fund schemes are broadly classified into the following groups:</b></p><ol><blockquote><li>Equity Schemes</li><li>Debt Schemes</li><li>Hybrid Schemes</li><li>Solution Oriented Schemes</li><li>Other Schemes</li></blockquote></ol><p><b>SEBI divided equity mutual fund schemes into ten categories thus.</b></p><ul><blockquote><li>Multi Cap Fund</li><li>Large Cap Fund</li><li>Large and Mid Cap Fund</li><li>Mid Cap Fund</li><li>Small Cap Fund</li><li>Dividend Yield Fund</li><li>Value Fund or Contra Fund</li><li>Focused Fund</li><li>Sectoral or Thematic Fund</li><li>Equity Linked Savings Scheme</li></blockquote></ul><p>Likewise, there are 16 categories of Debt Schemes, 6 categories of Hybrid Schemes, 2 categories of Solution Oriented Schemes, and 2 categories of Schemes.</p><p><blockquote>Market capitalisation of a company is the total number of shares available for trading on the stock exchanges, multiplied by the share price. Market capitalisation plays an important role in mutual funds as schemes’ objectives and strategies are often related to the market capitalisation (commonly called market cap) of the companies in which those schemes propose to invest.<p>In order to ensure uniformity in respect of the investment universe for equity schemes, SEBI defined large cap, mid cap and small cap companies as follows.</p></blockquote></p><p>Large Cap 1st to 100th company in terms of full market capitalization</p><p>Mid Cap 101st to 250th company in terms of full market capitalization</p><p>Small Cap 251st company onwards in terms of full market capitalization</p>",
            "Advantages":"<p>It is widely agreed in adviser and investor communities globally that Equity is the best asset class in comparison to other such as Realty, Gold, Fixed Income, Commodities, Currencies, Art and Antiquities, and Collectibles etc. When asset classes are compared on various parameters such as Risk, Return, Liquidity, Taxability, and Marketability, etc., Equity asset class stands out. It is possible that the financially illiterate may be sceptical about this statement, but it is proven and always verifiable that equity is the best asset class to create wealth in the long term.</p><p>Mutual Fund is the most flexible and transparent financial product and investment in India. With many options for asset allocation, within each asset class, diversification, and varieties of combinations of asset classes and categories, there is a scheme type or category for any type of investor with any target invest period and any investment objective.</p><p>Mutual funds are a great solution to achieve long term financial goals such as wealth creation, creating a retirement corpus, buying a house, or even going on a holiday. They are also suitable for short term goals such as parking money for short periods and earning higher return than savings bank account interest rate or achieving medium term goals that may be due in three to five years.</p><p>While other investment products may have some relatable benefits, mutual funds certainly stand out. Steady income, tax benefits, high return, low volatility or no risk, flexible investment options, low investment, recommended or compulsory holding period etc. may vary from one investment to another but mutual funds, depending on the choice can offer all these as a product type – a total package.</p><p>Benefits of mutual funds are many but the notable and the most significant ones are thus.</p><ul><blockquote><li><i><b>Diversification:</b></i> It is already said that mutual funds pool money from many investors. Such pooled money is invested across various securities, be it equity or debt or others, without any discrimination among investors in a particular scheme based on the amount invested individually. A mutual fund can distribute the AUM across many companies belonging to different sectors, which is not possible for an individual, who has limited resources.</li><li><i><b>Research:</b></i> Mutual fund schemes are managed by well-educated and experienced professionals. Supported by a big research team that studies the economy, sectors and companies, with access to critical and sophisticated research tools and ample money to spare no expense to deliver the highest possible return to investors, and above all adequate time, schemes managed by professional fund managers offer a lot to both – financially educated and illiterate investors.</li><li><i><b>Low Investment:</b></i> Mutual funds are often mistaken by some individuals as products meant for the rich, which is on the contrary to the fact. Mutual funds serve the needs of every type of investor be it the well-off or the destitute. With minimum investible amount as low as a hundred rupees and no limit on the maximum amount, they are suitable for all investors.</li><li><i><b>Flexibility:</b></i> The product offers varieties of investment options. It is the most flexible of all. One can make a one-time investment and hold it for any period, unconditionally. Those who cannot make a significant one-time investment can make systematic or recurring investment. Such a commitment can be broken any time in case one finds it difficult to continue the recurring investments, and there will be no penalty for that. One can make partial or full withdrawal of the investment.</i></li><li><i><b>Transparency:</b></i> Undoubtedly and unarguably, mutual fund is the most transparent financial product or investment available in India. While fixed income or interest based defined benefit investments such as the bank fixed deposit seem transparent, in investment parlance, the need for transparency goes beyond a guarantee of interest and principal. Mutual funds are researchable. They can be evaluated thoroughly. One can find the exact portfolio of stocks or securities in which a scheme invests and in what proportion. One can know how much a scheme churns the portfolio in a year. One can know how much a scheme has allocated to each sector and to the top companies and find the portfolio concentration risk if any. One can find critical factors such as the risk-adjusted return on investment, diverse types of risk, returns for varying periods, etc. No other product provides as much as a mutual fund does that an investor can use to take informed decisions.</li></blockquote></ul><p>While the concept of periodic and regularised investments is not a new concept that is already existent in the form of recurring deposits with banks or post offices, or premiums in cases of insurance policies, such system of investing plays a great role when it comes to investing in equity.</p><p>They call it the ‘Rupee-cost averaging’. Equity markets are volatile. There is no argument about it. And, they are unpredictable. So, there is no question of timing the market and investing exactly when the markets are low. Besides, waiting for the right time, investors may continue to wait for ever in the hope or supposition that the markets or the NAV can go down further, when they will make an investment</p><ol><blockquote><li><i><b>Systematic Investment Plan:</b></i> To inculcate the habit of investing, to give the benefit of investing very low amounts as a hundred, to ensure investment through the ups and downs of the markets (buy more units when the NAV is low and buy less units but rejoice when the NAV is high in profit – rupee cost averaging), mutual funds offer a feature called Systematic Investment Plan or S.I.P. In an S.I.P, investors select a date on which every month, a certain amount they decide will get debited from their bank accounts and gets invested in the mutual fund scheme of their choice.</li><li><i><b>Switch:</b></i> Also, within an AMC, investors can move from one scheme to another, if a particular scheme is not performing or if one is not satisfied for reasons whatever. As the AMC directly buys the units from the investor in case the latter wants to withdraw or redeem the investment, there is zero issue with finding a buyer to sell it.</li><li><i><b>Systematic Transfer Plan:</b></i> While in case of a switch investment from one scheme to another within an AMC is done as a one-time or a random transaction, in case of an STP, such switch is regularised like an SIP i.e. units for a specific amount are sold in one scheme systematically every week or month and bought in another scheme at regular intervals for a limited period or indefinitely as long as there is a balance of units or value in the source scheme.</li><li><i><b>Systematic Withdrawal Plan:</b></i> As opposed to random withdrawals or redemption from mutual funds, one can make systematic withdrawals (exact opposite of an SIP) to meet the income needs. On a selected date every month, the scheme redeems certain number of units for the chosen amount and deposits the money in the investor’s bank account. This option helps those who do not earn a pension or who need additional income to cushion their cash outflows</li></blockquote></ol>",
            "Risks_to_know":"<p>The risks associated with mutual funds are in fact related to the risk associated with the underlying securities in which they invest such as equity shares of companies, bonds, debentures, and government securities etc. The risk differs from scheme to scheme based on these types of securities in the portfolio, concentration or diversification, etc. Some of the factors that bring risk to mutual fund investments are –</p><ul><blockquote><li>Asset Class: Theoretically, equity (shares) is regarded generally as a risk asset class while Debt (bonds, fixed deposits, debentures etc.) is less risky and Gold lesser in comparison.</li><li>Market Capitalisation: Within equity, higher the allocation to companies with very high market capitalisation (large cap or blue-chip companies), lower is the risk. Higher the allocation to mid-cap companies, higher the risk in comparison to large cap. Small cap (based on the market capitalisation) is regarded the highest risk category.</li><li>Concentration: The main advantage of mutual funds is diversification. When a portfolio is spread across many companies belonging to different sectors, the risk is naturally reduced to a certain extent. However, some schemes based on their investment objective and strategy may invest in fewer companies which will increase the risk, even though the portfolio is spread across large, mid and small cap companies. Also, there are some schemes which invest in companies falling under a single sector e.g. Pharma, Banking, Auto, Infrastructure etc. Such sector-specific schemes carry higher risk than any diversified large cap or mid cap schemes. In case of debt funds, quality of the papers, coupon rate, yield to maturity, interest rates and bond prices in the market etc. can influence the risk, in addition to the trading or churning of these securities by the scheme.</li><li>Churning: Some schemes may invest in securities or companies and hold the investment for long term regardless of the volatility in the market price in the short term. However, there may be schemes that churn the portfolio frequently. Such schemes have a high turnover ratio. While churning is a risky activity but can result in higher than average expected return, wrong calls by fund managers and expenses can impact the return on investment or performance of the investment.</li><li>Economic Factors: There are other domestic and global economic factors such as government policies, inflation, interest rates, etc. that are beyond the control of any investor or fund manager, which may impact the performance of the scheme. Though these factors are uncontrollable, an efficient, educated and experienced fund manager analyses the information, does thorough research and take informed decisions. Nevertheless, as predicting the future is impossible for anyone, it holds true to investment management also. Hence, regardless of the greatness of fund management, investments in equity or debt for various reasons are exposed to some degree of risk always.</li><li>There can be many risk factors in addition to the above that influence the performance of a mutual fund scheme. Investors must consult their adviser or broker before investing and take informed decisions.</li></blockquote></ul>",
            "Taxation":"<p>Taxability or tax benefits of mutual funds differ based on the asset class. Taxation of mutual funds can be discussed in three ways viz. Deduction, taxation of Income, and taxation of profits.</p><ol><blockquote><li><i><b>Deduction:</b></i> Investments made in schemes that are categorised as Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) are eligible for deduction benefit of up to one lakh rupees under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. For a scheme to be categorised as Equity-oriented, the minimum allocation to equity must be sixty-five percent.</li><li><i><b>Income:</b></i> Dividend earned from mutual fund is subject to Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) at ten percent. However, if an investor, after making provisions for all deduction and exemption benefits falls below the basic tax exemption limit or paid excess tax, the TDS (tax paid in advance that is deducted by the AMC or scheme before paying the divided) can be claimed back as a refund.</li><li><i><b>Capital Gain:</b></i> Taxability of profit earned from the sale of mutual fund units depends on the period of holding of the units sold. This profit is called capital gain. In case of equity-oriented mutual funds, if the investment is held for a period of twelve months or more, the profit made from the sale of units is called the Long-Term Capital Gain. If the holding period is less than twelve months, it is called the Short-Term Capital Gain. In case of Debt funds, the period for calculating capital gain is thirty-six months.</li></blockquote></ol>"

            "Product_Name":"<p>Portfolio Management Service (PMS) is a custom-made professional service offered by a portfolio manager with the investment objective of different investors. Portfolio management is the art and sciences of selecting and overseeing a group of investments across asset classes like equity, debt, commodities, and cash that meet the long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance of the investors. Unlike mutual funds, the ownership of securities lies with the investor and managed by a professional manager.</p><p>PMS is an alternative to investors who are looking for investment into direct equity, as financial markets complex to understand and investing in financial markets and direct equity investment requires market knowledge, proper research and analysis, regular monitoring with lot of time consumption for investors.</p><p>Why Portfolio Management Services?</p><ul><li>Professional management</li><li>Ease of transactions</li><li>Personalized approach</li><li>Periodic review and rebalancing</li><li>Transparency</li></ul>",
            "categorization":"<p><b>Discretionary portfolio management</b> is the one where an investor gives the flexibility to the fund manager to manage the securities in the portfolio. While the individual goals, risk appetite and timeframe are taken into consideration, the manager adopts an appropriate strategy that he thinks is the best suiting the investment policy statement. In this, the investment is at the discretion of the fund manager and the client has no intervention in the investment process. Once the cash has been handed over to the professional, the investor sits back and trusts that the profits will roll on.</p><p><b>Non-discretionary portfolio managemen</b> is the one where a portfolio manager acts as an advisor or as a financial counselor. He simply gives investment ideas to clients and the clients have full right to take investment decisions.</p><p><b>Active portfolio management</b> is aimed at making better returns than overall markets. Majorly, a fund manager follows the contrarian approach in active management. Active portfolio management involves quantitate analysis of companies to evaluate the real value of stock in relation to its potential. For the same, the fund manager keeps away from efficient market hypothesis and relies on ratios to support his claim. Gains in active portfolio management majorly depend on fund manager skills.</p><p><b>Passive portfolio management</b> is the opposite of active portfolio management. In passive portfolio management, the fund manager believes in the efficient market hypothesis. In this the fund manager focuses on fundamentals of a company for stock price reflection. The turnover in portfolio is relatively lower than in the case of an actively managed portfolio, and good for long-term worth.</p>",
            "Advantages":"<ul><li>Portfolio management deals with the investment in different asset classes like equity, debt, cash and other assets too. For the same, one should have good market knowledge, proper research and analysis, and regular monitoring. Portfolio management helps investors with professional management by experienced fund managers.</li><li>Individuals focus on price for short term gains rather than value for long term gains. Portfolio management services help in building quality portfolio through profession management.</li><li>Portfolio management helps in building and managing portfolio at client level, it means each client portfolio is treated separately in view of the individuals’ risk appetite and goals. Hence, experiences of other investors will have no impact on one person’s investment.</li><li>Portfolio management services aims to maximize returns in the long run for wealth creation by investing in marketable securities with proper risk diversification.</li><li>Most of the portfolio management services build portfolio in equity asset class, as we know equity market is volatile and carry high risk factor in case of high value assets. The fund managers are well experienced and manage portfolios by diversifying the risk.</li><li>Even though portfolio management services are recommended for long term investment, they offer liquidity to exit any time in case of emergencies. Exit load is applicable as per the service provider, based on holding period.</li><li>Portfolio managers do portfolio rebalancing to maximize the returns by reducing risks when you do not get expected returns from the portfolio because of market fluctuations.</li></ul>",
            "Risks_to_know":"<ol><blockquote><li>Even though it is beneficial investing in portfolio management services, as the same is governed by SEBI to maintain good governance and lower fraud, a minimum capital of 50 Lakhs must be invested in PMS.</li><li>Being a customized product and managed at client level with the investment objective unlike mutual funds that are managed in pooled trust accounts, the expenses of PMS products are little higher.</li></blockquote></ol><p>Management fee can be 2.5% per annum and 0.5% are operational expenses per annum.

            "Taxation":"<p>PMS is managed by experienced professionals at client level; taxation would be done at client level. PMS Service provider will share capital gains or loss statement at the end of every financial year, with all the transaction details, short term and long-term capital gains or losses in different asset classes.

Cumulative FDs pay interest amount on maturity along with the principal, whereas non-cumulative FDs pays interest amount periodically as per the frequency (monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, annual) chosen and principal payment on maturity.",

In FDs an investor agrees not to withdraw or access their funds for a fixed period.</p><p><b>Non-Convertible Debentures</b> are long-term financial instruments with a debt obligation to issuer. These instruments are mostly unsecured by collateral and they rely on the creditworthiness and reputation of the issuer. Debentures which cannot be converted into equity shares are called non-convertible debentures (NCDs).</p><p><b>Perpetual Bonds</b> are debt instruments that do not have a fixed maturity and not redeemable. These bonds pay a steady stream of income forever. Perpetual bond payments are similar to stock dividend payments, as they both offer some sort of return for indefinite period. Because of its nature, there bonds are even viewed as a type of equity and not as debt.</p><p><b>Zero-Coupon Bonds</b> are the ones which do not pay any periodic interest called coupon. These bonds assume positive time value of money and pay par value or face value to investors on maturity. The biggest advantage of zero-coupon bond is its predictability of maturity value without worrying about market ups and downs if one does not intend to sell prior to maturity.</p><p><b>Tax-free Bonds</b> offer interest or coupon for longer duration to investors, which is tax-free. It means, one need not pay tax irrespective of the tax slab one falls under. These bonds are majorly offered by government and public sector enterprises for a period of 10 years and above. Money collected from the tax-free bonds is invested in infrastructure and housing development.</p><p><b>Government of India (GOI) Bonds</b> are commonly known as RBI bonds or GOI taxable bonds as they are offered by RBI and returns are taxable. Previously, these bonds were offered fixed interest rate for the investment tenure. Now, with the changes in the product, these bonds offer interest rate on floating basis every 6 months, based on the repo rate during the investment period. So, these bonds are named as floating rate savings bonds and returns are taxable. Only resident Indians are allowed to invest in these bonds.</p><p><b>Postal savings</b> systems provide depositors who do not have access to banks, a safe and convenient method to save money.

            "Risks_to_know":"<ul><li><b>Credit and Default Risk:</b> Credit risk is that a lender will not get paid all principal and interest on time as scheduled on a loan or other borrower obligation. Default risk is the risk that a lender takes on in the chance that a borrower will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligation. Lenders and investors are exposed to default risk in virtually all forms of credit extensions</li><li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> Interest rate risk is the potential for investment losses that result from a change in interest rates. How much interest rate risk a bond has depends on how sensitive its price is to interest rate changes in the market. The sensitivity depends on two things, the bond’s time to maturity, and the coupon rate of the bond. If interest rates rise, for instance, the value of a bond or other fixed-income investment will decline.</li><li><b>Inflationary Risk:</b> Inflationary risk is the risk that inflation will undermine an investment’s returns through a decline in purchasing power. Bond payments are most at inflationary risk because their payouts are generally based on fixed interest rates and an increase in inflation diminishes their purchasing power.</li><li><b>Reinvestment Risk</b> Reinvestment is the practice of using receivables like interest, coupons, dividends etc., from existing investments to purchase additional units of the same investment rather receiving the distribution in cash. In the process of reinvestment investors may not be able to get the same rate of return as received from the existing investment. This risk associated with re-investment option is called reinvestment risk.</li><li><b>Price Risk:</b> Price risk is the risk of a decline in the value of a security or a portfolio due to a variety of factors, excluding a complete downturn in the market. Diversification is the most common and effective tool to mitigate price risk. Financial tools, such as options and short selling, can also be used to hedge price risk.</li><li><b>Purchase Power Risk:</b> Purchase power risk is that the unexpected changes in consumer prices will penalize an investor’s real return from holding an investment. Inflationary risk results in purchase power risk. Supplies, Demand, Credit, interest rate, inflation are various factors which influences purchasing power of consumers.</li></ul>",
