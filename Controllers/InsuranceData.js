            "insurance": "<p>Life insurance deals with the life…sorry, death. Not the death of any living or non-living thing but specifically of human beings. The fundamental nature of insurance is, it deals with uncertainty. On the contrary, death is certain. So, how can a certainty be insured? True. Death is certain. But what is not certain about it is the time of its occurrence, which is paramount to human beings. Insurance is also fundamentally aimed at providing financial compensation for any financial loss suffered and not any sentimental or emotional relief or consolation.</p><p>The death of a person in old age, say for example someone in his or her eighties without any family member depending on him or her financially may not have a financial impact on anyone. However, the death of a person in his earning phase of life with a family looking up to him for their financial needs (not undermining the love, affection, moral strength, support, and other emotional needs) can be devastating to those dependants. So, life insurance, a concept that deals with uncertainty accepting death, which is certain, as a valid risk is not out of order because it is not about the event but time of the occurrence of the even that is critical.</p><p>Life insurance is a contract between an insurer and an insured (generally a policy holder). An individual proposes to insure his life by paying some amount or fee to an insurer. After a careful study of his or case, the insurer (or the insurance company), if the individual is qualifies for insurance, accepts his or her proposal. Upon acceptance, the individual pays a fee, which is called Premium, to the insurer. And, the individual’s life is insured by the company for a certain amount, which is called Sum Assured. In the even of untimely death of the policy holder or the insured during the term of the contract, the insurance company provides compensation i.e. sum assured amount (death benefit) to the nominee.</p><p>Insurance indemnifies actual financial loss. However, human life is invaluable. Nevertheless, insurance companies use a method called Human Life Value to estimate the maximum amount of risk cover (sum assured) for which a human’s life can be insured.</p>",
            "importance": "<p>Life insurance if the most important of all insurance types. Originally, insurance was invented as an arrangement to protect traders from financial loss to their business inventory. Later, it evolved to protect the owner of an asset from financial loss or expenditure incurred due to the damage or loss to the asset. Human life is an asset because of its potential to earn money and provide for the needs of the dependents. Hence, over time, insurance extended to cover human lives and thus life insurance emerged.</p><p>The importance of life insurance can be understood when the financial position and needs of a family are discussed and understood. Imaging a family of four – a couple and their two young ones. The man is the only earning member and there are no other income sources in the family. In the unfortunate death of the man, the sole earning member, the family will be left without any financial support for survival. How will then the living expenses of the family be met? How will the kids pursue higher education? How can the surviving mother manage to get a girl child married off to a suitable young man from an acceptable family? How will she survive in the old age when she cannot work? Life insurance is a boon for such deprived families.</p><blockquote><b>Points to be considered</b></blockquote><ol><Li>Understanding the need for life insurance</Li><Li>Estimation of required life insurance cover</Li><Li>Evaluating products and choosing right ones</Li><Li>Understand the pros and cons, and the cost of product</Li><Li>Disclose all material facts</Li><Li>Check all details in the policy document</Li><Li>Ensure continuity of the policy by paying premiums on time</Li><Li>Understand the claim procedure</Li><Li>Make family members know about the plan taken</Li></ol>",
            "categorization": "<p>Life insurance is broadly categorized as pure risk plan and a combination of risk cover plus savings or investment component.</p><ol><Li><strong>Term Assurance</strong><div>Term Assurance plans are commonly called term plans. They are pure risk benefit policies, provide high risk benefit for a low premium. These are suitable for those who have higher responsibilities and need high risk cover to protect their family’s financial needs.</div><p>There are 2 types of term plans</p><ul><Li><b>Term plan without return of premium –</b>These plans provides only death benefit, which is the sum assured, in case of death of the life assured during the policy term.</Li><Li><b>Term plan with return of premium –</b>These plans provides maturity benefit, which are total premiums paid excluding service tax if the life assured survives the policy term. In case of death of the life assured during the policy term, the nominee receives the sum assured as the death benefit.</Li></ul></Li></br><Li><b>Risk Benefit in combination with savings –</b>Endowment Plan, Money-back Plan, Whole Life Plan, Child’s Plan etc. These are also called Endowment Plans or more commonly, Traditional Plans.Endowment plans provide risk cover along with the savings option. It means, if something happens to the life assured and he or she is no more during the policy term, the nominee receives the sum assured and some benefits in the form bonuses (if any declared based on policy). If the life assured survives the policy term, he or she receives the maturity benefit.<p>Traditional plans are classified as PAR and NON-PAR plans based on the benefits offer.</p><ul><p><Li><b>PAR plans</b> are known as participating plans, which mean returns in these plans depend on the product/company performance, which is not guaranteed. PAR plans provide yearly bonuses called revisionary bonus and a terminal bonus which is paid either on maturity or on death of life assured, whichever happens first.</Li><Li><b>NON-PAR plans</b> are also known as non-participating plans These plans do not participate in overall performance of either the product or company. These plans provide guaranteed benefits which are shared to the investor and mentioned in the policy document. They do not provide any other benefits like revisionary and terminal bonuses.</Li><Li><b>Endowment plans – </b>Any insurance plan that pays a survival or maturity benefit at the end of the policy term is called an Endowment Plan.</Li><Li><b>Money back plan –</b> Provides survival benefits at regular intervals along with a maturity benefit at the end of term</Li><Li><b>Whole-life plan –</b>Provides maturity benefit as per the policy contract and provides the life coverage for whole life. Unlike regular Term or other Endowment plans, they do not have a specific maturity period. Whenever death happens, they pay the sum assured to the nominee.</Li><Li><b>Child plans –</b>These are similar to money back plans but provide survival benefit at specific intervals for child education and wedding goals. They are generally called children education endowment plan and marriage endowment plan.</Li></p></ul><Li><b>Risk Benefit in combination with investment – </b> Market linked insurance plans, where returns depend on market performance. These are called ULIPs (Unit Linked Insurance Plans)ULIPs provide market-based returns along with life cover. ULIPs offers various investment options in a single product from high risk to low risk, and investors can choose an investment option based on personal risk tolerance or appetite and also have the flexibility to switch the investment across different investment fund options without any restriction within the product.</Li><Li><b>Annuity Products (Immediate/Deferred): Annuity means pension. </b>Annuity products are offered by insurance companies where an investor need to pay the premium either in lump sum or in series for a specific period. In return, the investor receives regular income (annuity), starting either immediately or at a deferred date (some time in future). Annuity rate is decided and offered at the time of the starting of the annuity as per the prevailing annuity rates. Annuity received from these products is taxable as per the individual income tax slab.</Li><Li><b> A legacy to leave behind</b>A lump sum death benefit can secure the financial future of your children and protect their standard of living.</Li></ol>",

It means the people who matter most in your life may be protected from financial hardship if the unexpected happens.</Li><Li><b>Reduce stress during difficult times</b> None of us know what lies around the corner. Unforeseen tragedies such as illness, injury or permanent disability, or even death can leave you and your family facing severe emotional stress, and grief. With insurance in place, you or your family’s financial stress will be reduced, and you can focus on recovery and rebuilding your lives.</Li><Li><b>Financial security to dependents</b> No matter how good your financial position is, one unexpected event can see it all unravel very quickly. Insurance offers a payout so that if there is an unforeseen event, you and your family can hopefully continue to move forward without any financial constraint.</Li><Li><b>Peace of mind</b> No amount of money can replace your health and wellbeing, or the role you play in your family.

            "limitations":"<p>Life insurance, as a product does not have any limitations or disadvantages or whatsoever. It is a product designed with a great vision for the welfare and financial wellbeing of the humankind in the face of financial loss due to damage of an asset or death of an earning member in a family. Nevertheless, it is important to be adequately insured to secure the needs of the financial dependents. Mentioning any limitations of insurance will only be theoretical and deliberate but not practical.</p><p>Nevertheless, one limitation that can be cited is more related to the product than the idea of life insurance. While human life is invaluable, insurers may limit the maximum amount of life insurance an individual can buy on his own life or the dependents such as spouse or children etc. Generally, the maximum life insurance cover one can buy is linked to the income of a person.</p>",
            "tax_benefits":"<p>Life insurance policies provides tax benefit as EEE, it means exemption (deduction benefit) at the time of paying the premium, exemption on the earnings during the policy term, and exemption on maturity with some limitations and conditions.</p><p>Premium paid for insurance policy is eligible for deduction from the taxable income under SEC 80(C) of the Income Tax Act, subject to a maximum limit of Rs. 1.5 Lakh. It means, one can pay any amount of insurance premium but the maximum limit on the tax benefit is 1.5 Lakh.</p><p>All insurance proceeds like accumulated bonuses, surrender value, paid up value, cash bonus, maturity benefit, and death benefit, etc. either getting accumulated or paid to the policy holder or beneficiary during the policy period are exempted from tax under section 10 10(D). To get eligibility for tax benefit under section 10 10(D), premium paid in the policy should be less than 1/10th of the sum assured or 10 times annual premium should be the sum assured in the policy.</p>"

            "categorization":"<ol><Li><b>Indemnity Plans –</b> These plans are also known as traditional health insurance plans. These plans take care of your hospital expenses either through a cashless facility or reimbursement up to the total sum assured. Indemnity plans are available in two variants viz. individual policy and floater policy. Below are different kinds policies one can choose based on their requirement.<ul><blockquote><Li><b>Base plan –</b> Base plan is also known as regular health insurance plan. These plans cover hospitalization without any limitation in the claim up to the sum assured as per the insurance contract, on indemnity basis. There would be some limitation in coverage based on the product features.</Li><Li><b>Top up plan –</b> Top-up plans are basically add-on plans, which cover hospitalization costs outside the specified limit. One can purchase a top-up plan in addition to one’s regular or base health insurance policy. Top-up plans cost less and provide higher coverage. These plans covers single claim above the threshold limit.</Li><Li><b>Super top-up plan –</b> Super top-up plans is similar to top-up plans and covers the total of all hospitalization bills above the specified limit. It means specified limit is applied to all the claims in one year.</Li><li><b>Special plans –</b> These are the plans specially designed to meet the needs of senior citizens who are above 60 years of age. These are also called as Senior Citizen plans.</li></blockquote></ul></Li><li><b>Benefit Plans –</b> These plans are also known as fixed benefit plans. These plans provide fixed and guaranteed amounts equivalent to the sum assured in case of an occurrence of an insured event as per the policy terms mutually accepted by the insurer and the insured. Once the total sum assured is paid to the insured, the policy gets terminated. These plans are mostly available on individual basis only. Below are different kinds of policies available as per one’s requirement.<ul><blockquote><li><b>Critical Illness plan –</b> Critical Illness plans provide coverage against permanent or specific life-threatening illness. In case of critical Illness plans, insurers pay a lump sum amount, equal to the sum assured regardless of hospital expenses on acquiring a life threatening illness. This plan is also known as critical illness cover or dreaded disease policy.</li><li><b>Hospital Cash Benefit plan –</b> Hospital cash benefit policy provides a fixed amount in case of hospitalization. The cash benefit amount is pre-determined at the time of purchase of policy and is fixed. This amount can be used as per the insured’s need either for meeting additional expenses that are not covered by regular health insurance plan or as a compensation for the income loss during the period of hospitalization.</li><li><b>Personal Accident insurance plan –</b> Personal accident insurance policy can reimburse one’s medical cost and also provide compensation in case of disability or death caused by accidents. In case of death, the policy pays the total sum assured to the nominee. In case of disability, be it permanent or temporary, a specified percentage of sum assured is paid as per the insurance contract.</li></blockquote></ul></li></ol>",

            "limitations":"<p>There are no limitations to the concept of insurance. However, products created by insurers may have certain limitations through the policy terms, just as how we mentioned in the case of life and general insurances. Health insurance is very important, unarguably. It is only that some people who are well-off may not find a need to buy insurance, as they can afford the expenses out of their reserves or cash flows. But that is not the case with most families and individuals.</p><p>The limitation in case of health insurance can be in the form of maximum limit on insurance cover one can buy in spite of affordability. Second, depending on the features of the policy or the extent of the coverage of expenses, the premium may vary from company to company vastly and generally expensive with a majority of insurers. Other limitations of health insurance products include compulsory inclusion of unwanted features and exclusion of certain medical conditions when there is a claim, thereby increasing the financial burden on the policy holder, to some extent.</p><p>Nevertheless, one must understand that regardless of one’s financial position, health insurance is a great way to minimize the impact of expenses in case of hospitalization due to an illness and save a lot of money that can otherwise be invested for various other goals to secure one’s financial future.</p>",
            "tax_benefits":"<p>The premium paid by the employer is a before-tax business expense. Personal health insurance plans marketed and sold by private or national insurance companies are taxable. They are taxable because premiums are paid by individuals out of their after-tax income.</p><p>Premium paid on health insurance is tax-deductible under section 80D of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Under this section, a tax deduction is provided towards the health policy for oneself, spouse, and children.

            "importance":"<p>While there are many forms of insurance such as Life insurance, Health insurance, Home insurance etc., the Government making motor insurance mandatory clearly signifies the importance it has.

Making a gain unduly out of an insurance contract is against the core principles of insurance and is punishable by law. Hence, to avoid any discomfort, insurance principles strongly advocate disclosing of all material facts, whether asked or not by the insurer.</p><p>As it is said that non-life insurance deals with anything but life, it may sound like it does not deal with humans either, which is contrary to the fact. General insurance may not deal with death of a human being, but it deals with other aspects related to a person. For example, it deals with the health of a person and accident i.e. risks such as illness leading to hospitalisation and treatment, and disability caused due to accident are subject matters of general insurance.</p><p>Tangible assets generally have some economic value and they are susceptible to damages.

It aims to compensate the owner, be it an individual or an organization, in case of any damage to an asset or stock. However, insurance is based on the principle of indemnity, which means ‘to make good the loss’. This explains that insurance is not meant for gaining from the loss but to merely be compensated for the financial loss to replace the asset or to recover the value of the asset at the time of loss, as per the preference of the owner getting the asset insured.

            "advantages":"The advantages of having one’s assets insured are many but some of them are stated below.<ul><blockquote><li>Peace of mind: When one gets an asset (in fact, all assets) insured, one can breath easy from the fact that one will be compensated adequately in case of accidental loss or damage. That does not mean one must be negligent about protecting the asset from the possible occurrence of any kind of damage.</li><li>Natural calamities can be devastating for individuals as the properties can get damaged severely. Damage to the stock in trade for the business can cause a great strain on the finances. Insurance will ensure that such damaged asset or stock is easily replaced without any financial burden.</li><li>Insurance is a small price we pay for a great financial compensation. In the absence of insurance, replacing or repairing an asset can put a big hold in the pocket not just for individuals and families but also corporations.</li><li>With adequate insurance for all valuables and assets, the need to maintain a cash reserve to retain some risk is minimal or nil. Such amount can be best utilized by families or businesses to invest elsewhere for greater returns in the long term, which cannot be undermined at all.</li><li>Not only damage caused to one’s own body or asset or property, but damage caused to the lives and properties of others can also be covered through general insurance.</li></blockquote></ul>",
            "limitations":"There are no limitations of general or non-life insurance whatsoever. However, it is possible that some individuals or businesses who are not in their right mind may resort to unethical practices and deliberately damage one’s own assets with the intention of unduly gaining from insurance. One must understand that the surveillance and verification process undertaken by insurers is very stringent and flawless, and any such practices will not be regarded lightly. Persons resorting to malpractices will be punished to the full extent of the law, which is also a bad thing for one’s reputation in the society or neighborhood.<p>However, one limitation as regards not the concept of insurance, but the product can be cited. In case of products such as personal accident, insurers may limit the maximum amount of accidental disability insurance one can buy, though such limit is reasonable and high for a large number of individuals.</p>",
            "tax_benefits":"In addition to the natural advantages of having an asset insured, insurance also provides some tax benefits to the policy holder.<ul><blockquote><li>Businesses can claim the premium paid towards motor insurance as expenditure if the vehicle is used for business purposes only.</li><li>Claim admitted by the insurance in case of personal accidental disability is fully exempt from tax if the disability is permanent and proportionately exempt if the disability is temporary.</li><li>Compensation received or claim admitted in case of motor accidents is not taxable</li</blockquote></ul><p>Though health is a subject matter of non-life insurance, we shall discuss it separately in the health insurance section in details.</p>"
